# **Project Objectives 🏹**

❄ Major crops today are plagued by a variety of diseases. Diseases in crops can 
occur in various parts of the plant, such as the roots, stem, but leaves are the
most typical site for disease detection.

❄ It is difficult to detect and diagnose diseases because leaves have a variety
of sizes, shapes, and colors.

❄ Current disease diagnosis based on human scouting is time-consuming & expensive,
however, the advancements of machine learning and computer data processing helped
in automatically identify diseases in crops like rice, corn, wheat, cotton & tomato. 

❄ The goal of this project is to leverage computer-vision-based techniques
and build a model that can:
    
   ❄ Accurately classify a given image into a diseased category or a healthy leaf. 
    
   ❄ Accurately distinguish between many diseases, sometimes more than one on a single leaf.
   
   ❄ Deal with rare classes and novel symptoms.
   
   ❄ Address depth perception — angle, light, shade & age of the leaf.
